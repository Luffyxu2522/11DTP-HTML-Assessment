                    <h3>Gear Needed For Mountain Biking</h3>
                    <p> To enjoy mountain biking safely, riders need a sturdy mountain bike suitable for off-road trails, along 
                        with a properly fitted helmet for protection. Gloves, knee pads, and comfortable, breathable clothing 
                        help reduce the risk of injury and increase comfort on long rides. It is also important to carry water, 
                        snacks, and basic repair tools, such as a spare tube and a multi-tool, to handle any issues while on 
                        the trail. Additional accessories like sunglasses, protective eyewear, and proper shoes can further 
                        enhance safety and performance. You can find all the gear like this at places like Torpedo 7, Evo Cycles, 
                        and 3Sixty Sports.</p>
